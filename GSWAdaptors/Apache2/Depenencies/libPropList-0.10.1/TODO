o Clean up the code. It's messy. (This is urgent.)

o Library still needs some testing.

o Use Sun secure RPC?

o Write manual pages for defaults(1), PropertyList(5) and gsdd(8)

o replace #define BOOL with #ifndef Bool #define Bool
  BOOL is already typedefed in Xmd.h (so we can't even check if it is
  already defined)
