New features in 0.7.1:

o Fixed all the memory leaks (I hope). This should make gsdd usable
  with WindowMaker, etc.

New features in version 0.7:

o Changed memory management to OPENSTEP-style Retain / Release mechanism

o Implemented libFoundation's multiple-file approach (~/GNUstep/Defaults as
  directory containing domains as single files)

o GNU automake / autoconf support added, thanks to Alfredo Kojima

o Fixed a number of memory leaks and bugs
