13 Jan 2000 - Dan
	- Fixed a memory leak related to insertion/removal of objects
	  in dictionaries/arrays.
	- Fixed a crashing issue related to file synchronization.
	- Updated the code to not call memcpy if the source pointer is NULL
10 Oct 1999 - Dan
	- Fixed incorrect behaviour of the synchronize functions when there
          was no file to synchronize with
        - Fixed mem leak in synchronize code (for dictionaries).

05 Oct 1999 - Dan
	- Fixed compilation problems for FreeBSD and Solaris
	- gsdd and defaults no longer build (they are useless at this point)
	- fixed proplist parsing problem in filehandling.c

04/Oct/1999 - Dan
	- Fixed some flaws in the logic of PLSynchronize()
	- Renamed PLSynchronize() to PLDeepSynchronize(). kept PLSynchronize()
	  as an alias for backward compatibility.
	- Added PLShallowSynchronize() for non-recursize synchronization.

Sat Sep  4 23:11:07 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* (defaults|gsdd)/.cvsignore: We really don't want Makefile.in.

Sun Aug 29 00:46:08 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* filehandling.c: Random checks against if passed proplist_t is NULL.
	For example, attempt to PLSetUnchaneged() on a null pointer crashed
	WM badly. Probably, I add to much checks, but it's better than nothing.
	
	* filehandling.c (PLSave): Changed set of fwrite()'s to one fprintf().
	It seems, this is a bit more portable.

Fri Aug 27 03:19:40 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* (.|gsdd|defaults)/Makefile.am - fixed problems, when srcdir!=builddir,
	seems, again (see R. Nelson 19990101). Remove several targets, that
	provided by default. Add top directory to targets - so, no need to
	call make -f ../Makefile.
	
	* Accidently update libtool to 1.3.3 version.
	
	* Added proplist.c, proplist_y.c, */Makefile.in to the ignore list.

08/Aug/1999 - Dan

	* Fixed some problems in the configure script, when looking for
	gethostbyname() and socket().


07/Aug/1999 - Dan

	* Fixed memory leak in PLSynchronize()

	* Fixed a bug that caused proplists get with PLGetProplistWithPath()
	and PLGetProplistWithDescription() to be marked as 'changed' immediately
	after read even if not changed, and thus making PLSynchronize() do the 
	wrong thing.

	* Fixed a bug in PLSynchronize() that cause a data of type Dictionary 
	to be incorrectly synchronized. (There are still incorrect assumptions 
	about arrays that need to be fixed - see BUGS and comments in 
	filehandling.c)


1999-01-01 Raffaele Sena <raff@aromatic.com> via Russell Nelson <nelson@crynwr.com>

	* Fix for build directory different from package top directory. 

1998-12-11  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* proplist_y.c, proplist_y.y:
	Reverted cast until full solution available.

1998-12-10  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* proplist.c proplist.l: removed duplicate #include
	* proplist_y.c, proplist_y.y: ptr-to-int cast for 64-bitness
	* util.h: include string.h to avoid strlen warning

20/08/1998 - Alfredo

o Added patch related to file locking. 


13/08/1998 - Alfredo

o Fixed bug in PLGetStringDescription(). The special case of empty strings
  was not being handled, causing libPL to not be able to read proplists
  that it wrote itself,like:
  	(elem1, elem2, , elem4)
  where the 3rd element is an empty string ("").

o Fixed bug in PLDeepCopy(). The copied element that was appended to the array
  was being released.

22/07/1998 - Alfredo

o  Fixed crashing bug with bad proplist files


Sun Jul 19 11:40:57 EST 1998  Alfredo

o Integradted patch that fixed unescape character code in strings.
  


25/01/99 - Alfredo K. Kojima <kojima@windowmaker.org>

	* merged GNOME changes with Window Maker libPropList


2/10/1998 - Alfredo

	* fixed bug in unescstr()

1998-08-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

        * filehandling.c (PLGetProplistWithPath): Do not abort if file
        system does not support locks.

1998-08-23  Nat Friedman  <ndf@retrans.mit.edu>

        * getting.c (PLGetStringDescription): Quote zero-length strings or
        they will cause parse errors when loaded

Patch submited by Shigeru Miyata <miyata@kusm.kyoto-u.ac.jp>


Tue Nov 25 14:48:58 MET 1997   Bjoern Giesler <giesler@ira.uka.de>

o Integrated patches submitted by:

    Brian Martin <brian@goober.wireless.ucsc.edu>
      + output of config file errors w/file name and line number
        information
    Jehan Bing <jbing@enssat.fr>
      + bug fix for machines where sizeof(void *) != sizeof(int)

o New release 0.7.2

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? EST 1997   Alfredo Kojima <kojima@inf.ufrgs.br>

o bogus documentation on PLSetFilename()/PLGetFilename()

o Sys5 portability: flock changed to fcntl

o removed -p pl and -Ppl options for bison and flex for compatibility


Fri Sep 26 20:42:38 EST 1997	Alfredo Kojima <kojima@inf.ufrgs.br>

o defined YYERROR_VERBOSE

Sat Aug 16 23:47:34 EST 1997 	Alfredo Kojima <kojima@inf.ufrgs.br>

o string size passed to scanner was causing segfault in filehandling.c

o value returned from PLGetDictionaryEntry() was being released in 
gsdd/Commands.c

o gsdd/Main.c:CheckChange_multiple() was not checking if return value
of PL functions is NULL, which caused segfaults 


Fri Aug  8 14:16:01 EDT 1997

o Changed memory-management routines to OPENSTEP-style retain/release
  mechanism.

o gsdd reads libFoundation-style multiple-file defaults now.

o Fixed all the memory leaks (I hope).

o Added test/memtest.c, defines for memory debugging in plconf.h and
  tools/findleak.tcl to evaluate debugging output.

o Alfredo Kojima added automake/autoconf support

o New release 0.7.1

Fri Jul 25 18:24:00 EDT 1997

o Tuned the proplist.y file to be more forgiving on syntax errors. Due
  to the way synchronizing works, a line containing a syntax error is
  unfortunately "synchronized away", i.e. vanishes. Fix that.

Fri Jul 11 15:50:21 EDT 1997

o Added authentication.

o Added "shared" target.

Fri Jul 11 10:12:37 EDT 1997

o New release 0.5

o Added source code for the gsdd daemon

o Fixed a few bugs

o Added INSTALL file

Mon Jul  7 15:59:11 EDT 1997

o Fixed a bug in handling of variable argument lists

o Added source code for the defaults program

o Fixed a few bugs
